          <p>The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Not if I weaken first. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? You enjoyed that. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? We have a saboteur aboard. </p>

Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. How long can two people talk about nothing? Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise.</p>
